# Ball Battle Arena ⚔️

![Game Demo](./Media/ballFight.gif)

**Ball Battle Arena** is a physics-based action game where players face off against enemy balls on a floating platform. Developed as part of the [Unity Learn Junior Programmer Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer), this project introduces key concepts such as power-ups, coroutines, and physics-based movement using Unity's Rigidbody system.

## Features

- **Power-Ups:** Collect various power-ups to gain temporary advantage.
- **Enemy Waves:** Enemy balls spawn periodically, challenging players to survive and knock them off the platform.
- **Realistic Physics:** Rigidbody physics create dynamic interactions, adding weight and momentum to collisions and movements.
- **Coroutine-Based Timers:** Timed power-ups and enemy spawn rates are controlled using Unity coroutines for efficient and flexible game flow.

## Learning Objectives

- Implementing power-up mechanics and spawn management
- Using Unity’s Rigidbody system to add physics-based interactions
- Practicing coroutine functions for timed events
- Developing enemy and power-up spawn managers for dynamic gameplay
